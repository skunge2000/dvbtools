dvbarchive
----------

dvbarchive is designed to run 24/7 and will continuously archive a
single DVB multiplex.

Using command-line options, you specify the tuning parameters, the
list of channels (identified by their "service id") and the base
directory for the recordings to be written to.

dvbarchive will create one directory for each service, prefixing the
service name with the LCN (logical channel number) if available.



TDT - Freeview broadcasts every second.  Sky transponders appear to be every 10 seconds.  Freesat is ???.  Spain TDT is ???

**** MY CHANGES BELOW ****

I've modified it a bit to add command line options for DVB-T/T2/S/S2 and to add support for 32k and 16k carrier DVB-T2 options.

dvbarchive run without any arguments will list the command line options - and I've added mine to this.

I've tweaked the makefile so that it runs on Ubuntu and Raspbian in 2019, and increased the size of a buffer that otherwise 
seemed to cause crashes.  It's still very much a WIP.
